These Terms of Service (“TOS”) govern your access to and use of the Runtime Repaer software, services, documentation, and related materials (collectively, the “Service”) provided by Runtime Reaper (“Provider”, “we”, “us”). By accessing or using the Service you agree to these TOS.

## 2. Definitions

* **Authorized Testing:** Security testing performed only on systems and assets for which the Tester has explicit, written authorization from the owner or controlling party.
* **Tester / You:** Any individual or organization using the Service.
* **Prohibited Use:** Any use that violates Section 5 below.

## 3. Permitted Use

You may use the Service **only** to perform lawful security testing and red-teaming activities on systems for which you hold **explicit, written authorization**. Permitted activities must comply with all applicable laws and these TOS.

Examples of permitted use:

* Performing penetration tests or vulnerability assessments on customer systems where you have written consent.
* Internal red-team exercises authorized by the organization that owns the assets.
* Research and development on isolated lab environments you control.

## 4. Authorization Requirement (ABSOLUTE)

Before using the Service against any target you MUST obtain and retain **written authorization** from an owner or authorized representative of the target asset. The authorization must:

* Identify the target systems, IP ranges, or domains in scope.
* Specify permitted testing dates/times and types of testing allowed.
* Be signed or otherwise verifiably approved by the owner/authorized representative.

You must provide proof of such authorization to Provider upon request.

## 5. Prohibited Use

The following uses are expressly prohibited:

* Testing systems, networks, services, applications, or data for which you DO NOT have explicit written authorization.
* Distributing malware, creating backdoors, or performing actions intended to cause harm, destruction, or data theft.
* Provisioning the Service to third parties who lack authorization for the target assets.
* Using the Service to evade law enforcement, commit fraud, or facilitate criminal activity.
* Attempting to access Provider’s infrastructure, systems, or data without authorization.
* Reselling, sublicensing, or publicly redistributing the Service or its outputs in violation of licensing terms.

Prohibited activities include (but are not limited to): denial-of-service attacks on production services without written approval, exfiltrating confidential customer data, or selling access to exploited systems.

## 6. Responsible Disclosure & Reporting

If testing uncovers security vulnerabilities in third-party products or services, you must:

* Refrain from public disclosure until the affected vendor has had reasonable time to respond.
* Promptly notify the asset owner (and Provider if the vulnerability affects Provider) with clear, actionable details.
* Cooperate in good faith to coordinate remediation and disclosure timelines.

## 7. Data, Privacy & Logs

* You are responsible for any data you send through or collect using the Service.
* Provider may log usage and technical data for security, abuse prevention, billing, and improvement. Provider will handle logs consistent with its Privacy Policy.
* Provider may suspend access if it detects potential unlawful or abusive behavior.

## 8. Intellectual Property

* Provider retains all rights, title, and interest in the Service (software, documentation, trademarks).
* You retain ownership of your data, reports, and findings unless otherwise agreed in writing.

## 9. Warranties & Disclaimers

* **No Warranty:** The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” Provider disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied, to the maximum extent permitted by law.
* **No Authorization Warranty:** Provider does not and cannot determine whether you have proper authorization to test any target — that responsibility is yours alone.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Provider’s aggregate liability for claims relating to the Service is limited to the amount you actually paid Provider in the 12 months prior to the claim (or £/€/$100 if none). Provider is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages.

## 11. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold Provider harmless from claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your breach of these TOS or your unauthorized or unlawful use of the Service.

## 12. Termination & Suspension

Provider may suspend or terminate your access immediately if:

* Provider reasonably suspects unlawful activity or breach of these TOS.
* You fail to provide proof of authorization when requested.
* You materially breach any term and fail to cure within any required cure period (if provided).

Upon termination, any outstanding fees remain payable; Provider may delete or retain data per its policies.

## 13. Compliance with Law & Export Controls

You must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and export control requirements. You are responsible for obtaining any required permits or licenses.

## 14. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

These TOS are governed by the laws of Nigga. Disputes will be resolved in the courts of FcukYou, unless the parties agree in writing to alternative dispute resolution.

## 15. Changes to TOS

Provider may modify these TOS from time to time. Significant changes will be posted and, where required, notified. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

## 16. Miscellaneous
